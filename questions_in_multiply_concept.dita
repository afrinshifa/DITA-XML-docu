        <p>1. <b>What is the concept of multiplication in math?</b></p>
        <p><i> In math, multiplication is the process of combining or scaling numbers to find the
                total value of repeated additions. It involves multiplying two or more numbers to
                obtain a result known as the product. Multiplication is used to find the total
                quantity when the same value is repeated multiple times or to determine the result
                of scaling one value by another. For example, multiplying 3 by 4 would give you a
                product of 12, indicating that you have three sets of four, resulting in a total of
                twelve.</i></p>
        <p>2. <b>How can I multiply numbers using a calculator application?</b></p>
        <p><i>To multiply numbers using a calculator application, enter the first number, then press
                the "x" or "*" button (depending on the calculator app) to indicate multiplication,
                and finally enter the second number. Press the "=" button to obtain the product of
                the two numbers.</i></p>
        <p>3.<b>Can a JPS calculator application handle multiplying decimal numbers?</b></p>
        <p><i>Yes, JPS calculator application can handle multiplying decimal numbers. Simply enter
                the decimal numbers using the appropriate decimal point button on the calculator,
                press the "x" or "*" button to indicate multiplication, and then press "=" to obtain
