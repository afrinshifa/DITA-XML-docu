        <p><b>1.What is the concept of summing up in math?</b></p>
        <p><i> In math, the concept of summing up refers to the process of combining or adding
                numbers together to find their total or sum. It involves adding two or more numbers
                to obtain a result known as the sum. This concept is commonly used to find the total
                value of a set of numbers or to perform basic arithmetic operations like addition.
                For example, if you have the numbers 2, 4, and 6, summing them up would give you a
                total of 12.</i></p>
        <p><b>2.How can I quickly calculate the sum of multiple numbers using a calculator
                application?</b></p>
