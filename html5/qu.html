        <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">1.</strong><strong class="ph b"> What is the concept of subtraction in math?</strong></p>
        <p class="p"><em class="ph i">In math, subtraction is the process of taking one number away from another to find the
                difference between them. It involves removing or subtracting a quantity from a given
                value. The result of a subtraction operation is called the difference. Subtraction
                is often used to compare two quantities or find the remaining amount after taking
                away a certain value. For example, if you have 10 apples and you eat 3, the
                subtraction operation of 10 minus 3 would give you a difference of 7, indicating
                that you have 7 apples remaining.</em></p>
        <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">2.How can I subtract numbers using a calculator application?</strong></p>
        <p class="p"><em class="ph i">To subtract numbers using a calculator application, enter the first number, then press
                the "-" button, and finally enter the second number. Press the "=" button to obtain
                the difference between the two numbers.</em></p>
        <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">3.Can JPS  calculator application handle negative numbers in subtraction?</strong></p>
        <p class="p"><em class="ph i">Yes,  JPS calculator application can handle negative numbers in subtraction. Simply
                enter the negative number using the appropriate button or symbol (-) on the
                calculator, and follow the same steps as subtracting positive numbers to obtain the
                correct difference.</em></p>
